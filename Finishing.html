    Persisting at its core is finishing what you started. For some this will be extremely easy for others like myself, it was not that easy. There are so many factors that come into play in order to finish your college degree.
    One of my favorite quotes of all time is one by Thomas Jefferson. He once said, “If you want something that you have never had before, you better be willing to do things that you have never done before.”
    Sometimes college will be hard at times. There will be things out of your control that will impact you. Life will happen, you may have a bad break up or oversleep and miss a test. Your grandpa may get sick and you may have to leave in
    the middle of the day to make it home in time. There may be semester where you didn’t get enough financial aid or that you have to work full time to be able to pay for rent. But there will also be so many good times and so many people who will help you along the way. There will be people who will fight for you and people who be cheering for you to get to the finish line.
