    <h1>The Application</h1>
    <p>
      <ol>
        <li> Most schools will have an application on <a href="https://www.applytexas.org/adappc/gen/c_start.WBX">Apply Texas</a>, <a href="https://www.commonapp.org/">The Common App</a>, <a href="https://www.coalitionforcollegeaccess.org/"> The Coalition Application</a>, or they will have their own college application on their website.
          <ul>
            <li>Double Check the school's admission's website that you are applying to </li>
            <li>Here is an example of an <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/admissions/">admission's website</a></li>
            <li>If you need help finding your school's Admission's Website use <a href="Google.com">Google</a> + your school's name + Admissions</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
