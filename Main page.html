  <H2>The Purpose</H2>
    The purpose of this website is to give you an inside view from someone who was a first generation college student and from someone who has been College Counseling for over 10 years now. I have experienced so much and I have been fortunate to learn from some of the best in this field. At the end of the day I just want to make sure that you have all of the resources to help your possible, possible.
